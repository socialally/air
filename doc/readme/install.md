## Install

```
npm i air
```

Note that currently we do not own the `air` package and we are attempting to resolve this. Therefore this module is currently published to a *private* registry. This project is open-source and if we resolve the package name dispute will be published to the public registry as `air` otherwise an alternative package name will be used.

In the meantime you can depend upon the git repository:

```
"air": "socialally/air"
```
